# About Me
I'm a CS student at Carleton College. I'm not sure exactly which fields I want to specialize in. Right now, I'm focusing on my work with the Carleton Digital Humanities Office (which entails working with Omeka plugins and themes) as well as working on small projects outside of school in a variety of areas.
## Interests
I love math, and I find low-level programming really enjoyable. Optimizing code and working with algorithms is really cool. I just bought a STM microcontroller, and I'm currently working on figuring out how to make the LEDs light up! I also am fascinated with the calculus behind neural networks, and I'd love to make one of my own. Beyond that, I really just love the feeling of getting a program to work correctly. I've been dipping my toes into a bunch of different areas and seeing what feels right. Stay tuned to my GitHub for more updates about my projects.
### Familiar programming languages
Experienced in:
- Java
- C++
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

Exposure to:
- Rust
- Python
- SQL
- PHP
## Projects
### Current projects
- Matrix inverse calculator (C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Omeka plugins and themes with Carleton Digital Humanities (HTML, PHP)
- Searchable Olympics database for CS 257 at Carleton (SQL, Python, HTML, CSS)
- Punch force sensor (STM Microcontroller, Rust)
- Personal website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
### Future projects
- Single-layer neural network (hopefully I can get it to recognize handwritten digits!)
- Web poker game (hoping to learn NodeJS and Angular for this one)
- New York Times Spelling Bee Solver (I love the Spelling Bee game, and I'd love to come up with an interactive helper tool)
## Goals
- Learn more about neural networks
- Get better at coding in Rust
- Have a really cool internship experience and apply my skills in a more applied setting
- Learn guitar
- Get better at Spanish
